kor.1.d:0 "Stability in Korea could not be achieved when radicals like Kim Il-sung and Shin Chae-ho keep poisoning the youth minds. Therefore, after considering the advices of his ministers, Kim Koo took the difficult decision of ordering the assassination of Kim Il-sung andShin Chae-ho. Their death wasn't ignored by their many followers, who ended up rioting in the streets of Seoul, Busan and Pyongyan, destroying street lights and burning the respective plazas. \nThese demonstrators were met by bullets of the police and the army, thing that provoked the resignation of many of our generals."
kor.1.a:0 "If lucky, our future will be brighter..."
kor.2.d:0 "Finally the first Korean elections have been carried out! After a full day of vote counting, the winner has been revealed, he being:" 
kor.2.a:0 "Kim Koo, the Korean hero!"
kor.2.b:0 "Syngman Rhee, the Anti-communist."
kor.3.d:0 "The military junta led by Lee Beom-seok didn't last long after the anarchist generals tried to take power, succeding in their mission. A gunfight was heard in the morning in the former royal palace, Ji Cheon-cheong and Hong Beom-do were shot to death, while Lee Beom-seok was found dead in his car some streets away of the palace. Hours after, Kim Il-sung, Kim Won-bong and Kim Jwa-jin announced by radio that the only way to save the nation was through an anarchist government. They also stated that the famous anarchist philosopher, Shin Chae-ho, will be coming back from exile in China to help stabilize the nation" 
kor.3.a:0 "Sacrifices have to be made."
kor.5.d:0 "The military junta led by Lee Beom-seok didn't last long after the anarchist and communist generals tried to take power, but fortunately they failed in their mission. A gunfight was heard in the morning in the royal palace, Hong Beom-do was shot in the arm and shoulder by anarchist generals, the shoots were heard by the guard of the palace who caught Kim Jwa-jin and Kim Won-bong red-handed, to then proced to shot the anarchist generals to death. Lee Beom-seok reported that he was attacked by Kim Chaek in his way home, he also said that he was very lucky and would probably be dead if the man's gun didn't jammed. However, the assassin managed to scape before Lee had the opportunity to shoot back. Now general Hong Beom-do is being transported to Seoul hospital, before entering the ambulance which he stated that he was fine and it would take more than two traitors to take him down. Finally, Hong Beom-do assured the press that the junta now has the duty to execute all the generals who collaborated in the plot."
kor.5.a:0 "Hopefully this is the end of the storm."
kor.6.d:0 "The military junta of Korea decided that the best way to assure the stability of Korea is by restoring the Korean throne. However, a big problem remains about who should be the new leader of the Korean nation. \n\nIn one hand, Yi Kang is the eldest song of emperor Gojong, nonetheless he was born by Lady Jang, a court lady-in-waiting of King Gojong, not the king's official consort or concubine, therefore having a king with that lineage would be humillating for our population. \n\nIn the other hand there's Yi Un, son of Emperor Gojong and Imperial Noble Consort Sunheon, who would be the perfect option if it wasn't for the fact that he was the protégé of emperor Meiji himself, and was a general of the Japanese army." 
kor.6.a:0 "Yi Kang is the only option."
kor.6.b:0 "We shall pardon and crown Yi Un."
kor.7.d:0 "A delegation from Korea has approached us today, offering another deal. They propose to renovate the non-aggression pact between our nations, as well as giving military access to our armies again in exchange of guaranteeing their independence in case of a foreign attack. How should we respond?"
kor.7.a:0 "This would benefit us both."
kor.7.b:0 "We won't negotiate with former subjects."
kor.8.d:0 "The Korean government has approached us today asking something incredibly polemic: the annexation of the province of Jiandao, populated almost entirely by Koreans. Jiandao has been part of China since the times of the times of the Qing dynasty, however, transfering the region could impede any irredentist movements in the future, as well as assuring Korean support in future wars. What shall we do?"
kor.8.a:0 "Okay, they can have it, but nothing else."
kor.8.b:0 "How dare they?"
kor.9.d:0 "Today the Koreans approached our delegation with an interesting proposition. They said that if we guarantee their independence in case of a foreign attack, they would concede us a favourable trade deal. How should we respond?"
kor.9.a:0 "Sounds like a good proposition."
kor.9.b:0 "It's not worth the risk."
kor.10.desc:0 "Now that the kingdom has been restored, it is time to choose which flag will represent the Korean nation."
kor.10.a:0 "Our current flag is perfect."
kor.10.b:0 "The flag of 1882 will represent our nation."
kor.10.c:0 "A flag with the seal of the Yi family is the right option."
kor.10.d:0 "A flag with the seal of the Yi family, but not forgetting the symbols of the four elements."

jappact.1.d:0 "A delegation from Korea has approached us today, offering a deal. They stated that they will be willing to transfer us rights of extraction in some mines in the north side of the Korean peninsula, if we sign a non-aggression pact with them in exchange. Shall we accept?"
jappact.1.a:0 "Of course, this will benefit us both."
jappact.1.b:0 "We would prefer having total control over the peninsula."
jappact.2.d:0 "The Japanese government accepted our deal, let's hope peace between our nations remains forever."

jappact.3.a:0 "Ttong!"
jappact.4.d:0 "A delegation from Korea has approached us today, asking us to transfer them the control of some territories around northern China, they argument that this would help us to have a lesser cost of ocupation and to get less casualities due to partisans. Shall we accept?"
jappact.4.a:0 "More manpower for our troops then."
jappact.4.b:0 "The Koreans should learn not to make stupid propositions."
jappact.5.d:0 "The Japanese government accepted our proposal, our garrisons will begin mobilizing now."
jappact.5.a:0 "Manse!"
jappact.6.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Japanese government refused our proposal."
jappact.6.a:0 "Ttong!"

japfood.1.d:0 "The Japanese population in 1936 was easily feed by the Manchurian crops, but now that we don't have acces to them, a food shortage has affected the nation. The government must act quickly, not only to save its people, but to save itself from the extremist voices among the army and navy who demand a solution."
japfood.1.a:0 "A serious hit to our pride."
japfood.2.d:0 "Some days after the government announced food priority to the members of the armed forces, protests began forming in the capital, with a group of people deciding to march towards the congress, hoping that the government hears their pleadings. However, when the mob was only one street away from their destination, they were met by soldiers, which did not hesitated to load and aim their weapons at them. Both sides were waiting for the government response, until it came, it being:"
japfood.2.a:0 "How dare they defy our decision? Shoot them, NOW!"
japfood.2.b:0 "We shall cancel the promised benefits for the army."
japfood.3.d:0 "Due to the incompetence of the government to end the famine, a group of soldiers, commanded by young officers and members of the navy, entered the congress and demanded the transfer of power to Isoroku Yamamoto. The ones who resisted or refused were shot with no hesitation. The next day a radio message was mited in the whole Japanese nation, in which Yamamoto stated that he and the emperor will fix what the old government did not."
japfood.3.a:0 "Let's hope this fixes the situation."
japchi.1.d:0 "Following the Chinese defeat in the Second Sino-Japanese war, our government has decided to appoint Wang Jingwei as the leader of our puppet state in China, due to his collaborationism with our mighthy nation."

japchi.2.a:0 "Banzai!"
japchi.3.d:0 "After kicking the Japanese out of China, the legitimate leader of the nation returned and demanded the arrest of Wang Jingwei for treason against the state and the Kuomintang, but to his surprise, Wang had handed himself to the Chinese authorities even before he arrived. The traitor said no words to the public besides "I did what I had to do to save China". Now he awaits his trial in the capital."
japchi.3.a:0 "Right or not, he's probably going to jail, or worse."
japchi.4.d:0 "Today Ma Zhanshan approached us saying that he abhorred the nonresistance policy of the weak nationalist government and that he was willing to side with us. Naturally, we accepted this valuable offering."
japchi.4.a:0 "Let's hope he doesn't defect us too."
japchi.5.d:0 "Today Ma Zhanshan defected our army, the reason being "our incompetence in the war effort, and nonresistance policy against the Japanese". This naturally angered our leader, but there is nothing the can do about it."
japchi.5.a:0 "Good damn Ma!"
japchi.6.d:0 "Today a mounted messenger approached us with a letter from Ma Zhangsha of the Chinese army. In it he stated that his dissatisfaction with the incompetent Chinese government had reached its limits, offering us to join our forces. The only thing the humble general asked for was an enourmous amount of gold and the latest equipment we could offer him. Whatever we decide, we must remember how he joined us in 1931 after defecting the Chinese army, only to defect us too and became one of the most well known guerrilla leaders in Manchukuo."
japchi.6.a:0 "This will surely hit the Chinese war effort."
japchi.6.b:0 "Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."
japchi.7.d:0 "Following the Russian defeat in the Second Russo-Japanese war, our government has decided to appoint Konstantin Rodzaevsky as the leader of our puppet state in Vladivostok, due to his collaborationism with our government during his exile in Manchuria."

jap.1.d:0 "After its annexation in 1910, Korea has remained occupied by our mighty nation, however, the Korans still remain attached to their old culture and language. Voices among the government proposed an assimilation campaign in Korea, consisting in promoting the usage of the Japanese language and names, enacting press censorhip, and represing any sort of resistance in Korea. Nonetheless, we have to decide if we are going to continue these policies or if maybe it is time to recognize the Korean culture."
jap.1.a:0 "The Korean people will become one with the Japanese."
jap.1.b:0 "What kind of question is this? Continue the assimilation policy!"
jap.1.c:0 "We should respect our fellow Asians."
jap.2.d:0 "Due to the increase of Japanization policies in Korea, riots began happening in the streets of Seoul, Busan and Pyongyang. At first it was only a student protest, but then workers and farmers were reported to go on strike in many regions of the peninsula. Naturally they were met by our bullets, but astonishingly, a month after that event uprisings began happening all over Korea, until Korean militias managed to take control over city capitols and Japanese forts, with rumours of veteran of the 1919 uprising Lee Beom-Seok as well as communist leader Kim Il-Sung entering the region. Now we are facing a full-blown revolution."
jap.2.a:0 "We have crushed them before, and we will do it again."
jap.2.b:0 "It's now or never, for our future!"
jap.4.d:0 "A group of young army officers and members of the navy has succeeded in assassinating various government officials, as well as the prime minister. They have occupied Tokyo city and have secured control of the Imperial Palace, announcing their intent to purge the government of 'corrupt officials' and 'ideological threats'..\n\nTheir actions had an unexpectedly large following in the military, where intended counter-operations were forestalled by mass arrests and assassinations of elements loyal to the old government. Faced with the sudden and overwhelming nature of events, as well as rebel control of the palace, the Emperor has made no move to denounce the rebels.\n\nOrganized government resistance seems already to crumble, and the rebels are expected at any time to announce the establishment of total Imperial control to all areas of domestic, foreign, and military policy."
jap.4.a:0 "Tennōheika Banzai!"
jap.5.d:0 "The Japanese have approached us with a deal they called the "Anti-communist pact". In it, they stated that we should put our differences aside in order to erase communism in China. They say they understand how the communists are a menace to both our government and theirs, and therefore, they propose a defensive alliance. In it, each part would promise to defend the other in case of a war against any communist clique or revolt in China, as well as providing military access to ease the collaboration of our armies. How should we respond?"
jap.5.a:0 "The enemy of my enemy, is my friend."
jap.5.b:0 "We won't collaborate with any barbarians."
jap.6.d:0 "The Kuomintang has accepted our deal. Each part will promise to defend the other in case of a war against any communist clique or revolt in China, as well as providing military access to ease the collaboration of our armies."
jap.6.a:0 "Perfect."
jap.7.d:0 "The Kuomintang has refused our deal. We will have to destroy communism by ourselves."
jap.7.a:0 "As long as they don't try to invade Manchuria, it's fine."
jap.8.d:0 "Now that the Chinese are at war with the communists, it is time to join them in their struggle against the red devil!"
jap.8.a:0 "Tennōheika Banzai!"
jap.9.d:0 "Now that the Japanese are at war with the communists of China, it is time to join them in their struggle against the red devils!"
jap.9.a:0 "Onwards, to save China!"
jap.10.d:0 "Now that democracy is back to Japan, it is time to choose the new prime minister of Japan. After a day of voting, the results were may public. The new leader of the Japanese is:"
jap.10.a:0 "Kijuro Shidehara, the pacifist!"
jap.10.b:0 "Tetsu Katayama, the socialist!"
jap.10.c:0 "Ikuo Oyama, the reformist!"
jap.11.d:0 "The Japanese have sent a great amount of officers and military support in order to rehabilitate the Korean military, greatly helping the rebuilding of our army."
jap.11.a:0 "The help is welcome."
jap.12.d:0 "The Japanese have began investing in our economy, as well as delivering humanitarian aid in order to rehabilitate the Korean economy, greatly helping the rebuilding of it."
jap.12.a:0 "The help is welcome."
jap.13.d:0 "Whispers and rumours were heard in Nagoya, the provisional capital of the communist revolt. It was said that political elements were plotting to kill Kyuichi Tokuda, socialists and anarchists hated him as much as the fascists and conservatives they were fighting, due to his authoritarian leadership and purges. Disunity among the revolting side was great, until one day, an anarchist youngster murdered the leader of the revolution, as well as of the communist party. \n\nHowever, due to all the important anarchist leader being excecuted by the Japanese government in the 10's and 20's, there was nobody to take Tokuda's place, thus creating a great power vaccum among the revolt, that is greatly affecting the war effort. \n\nOnly one person is capable of leading the leftist forces now, due to better options being either dead or in regions controlled by the fascists: Toyohiko Kagawa, a labor activist and writter, but unfortunately, also a protestant christian. Having a well-known religious adherent as the leader of our movement may not be likeable, but having no leader at all may be worse." #Then, what shall we do?
jap.13.a:0 "A cause with no leader is doomed to be defeated."
jap.13.b:0 "Religion shall not empoison the revolution!"
jap.15.d:0 "Following the fall of the government after Tokuda's assassination, many communist militias began fighting the anarchist ones, provoking a great defection of socialist soldiers, which thought anarchists and communists were fighting for a thirst of power, instead of to help the Japanese people. This secured the victories of the fascist side, but the greatest hit for the revolutionaries was soon to come. \n\nConservative and fascist supporters in Nagoya launched a coup and stormed the building formerly used by Tokuda, where supposedly the government was located. But it was empty. The only thing they found was a book with a note over its cover, which said "The war is lost. Go home now". \n\nThe remnants of the leftist revolt have began surrendering, and even though the casualties of the war were high, there is nothing capable of stopping the rising sun now."
jap.15.a:0 "Tennōheika Banzai!" 
jap.16.d:0 "The Taisei Yokusankai has proved to be uncapable of bringing greatness and stability to the Japanese Empire. Those who fought braverly against the communist menace must and will be the new leaders of Japan, but one problem remains, two factions are currently advocating to become the new leaders of the empire. In one hand, there is the Tohokai, which imitating Italian fascism and German nazism pursues to restore the Samurai and Neo-confucian ethics; while in the other there is the Kokumin Domei, which advocates for a corporatist state, as well as the creation of an economic union between Japan and its puppets. Then, who deserves to be the new leader of the empire of the rising sun?"
jap.16.a:0 "Seigo Nakano and the Tohokai."
jap.16.b:0 "Adachi Kenzo and the Kokumin Domei."
jap.17.d:0 "Toyohiko Kagawa himself has sent a letter to [Root.GetLeader], stating that Japan has had enough bloodshed for the rest of its history, and that for the lives of all the Manchurians, Koreans and Japanese, he is willing to negotiate a peaceful reunification between our nations. He promises to restore emperor Hirohito to the throne, as well as banning the most radical leftist parties and an amnesty to all the generals who fought in the war in the fascist side, but if we accept, power will remain on him and his ministers, and the more totalitarian and nationalistic parties will be banned as well. How should we respond?"
jap.17.a:0 "Peace at last."
jap.17.b:0 "We can't trust any commies."
jap.18.d:0 "Now that the sun is rising again, the Japanese have demanded our government to pledge allegiance to theirs again. We might refuse, but that would most likely end with a Japanese invasion, though, we can always try to fight them back, after all they had a civil war just some months ago."
jap.18.a:0 "We have no option, do we?"
jap.18.b:0 "We won't be slaves of anyone!"
jap.19.d:0 "Prime minister Fumimaro Konoe has proposed the idea of forming a party to unite militarists, traditionalists and socialists under one banner, called Taisei Yokusankai. Many politicians support the idea, however, some think having a party with no previous identity will fail to unify the people under its leadership. Some propose transfering power to the Tohokai, which imitating Italian fascism and German nazism pursues to restore the Samurai and Neo-confucian ethics, while other support the Kokumin Domei, which advocates for a corporatist state, as well as the creation of an economic union between Japan and its puppets."
jap.19.a:0 "The Taisei Yokusankai will bring greatness to the Japanese."
jap.19.b:0 "Seigo Nakano and the Tohokai will mantain order."
jap.19.c:0 "Adachi Kenzo and the Kokumin Domei will stabilize the nation."

chi.1.d:0 "Today a bomb was detoned in a meeting between the members of the Kuomintang. The explosion killed Chiang Kai-Shek instantly and injured Wang Jingwei, who was transported to the nearest hospital in hope he survives. An investigation has already began aiming to find out who did it, though people has already blamed the communists of Yan'an."
chi.1.a:0 "Call Dai Li and Chen Cheng, now!"
chi.2.d:0 "After what happened to Chiang Kai-Shek, some people in the Kuomintang were suggesting something that the generalissimo would have never let happen: Negotiate with the communists of Yan'an. It would stop these pointless attacks between our own people, and if we are lucky we might even manage to, finally, unificate our nation."
chi.2.a:0 "We will make our best efforts."
chi.3.d:0 "Following the terrorist attack in Nanking, Chen Cheng and Dai Li discussed the fate of the Chinese government. After a long meeting between them and other members of the Kuomintang, they decided to appoint Dai Li as the leader of the country. Well known for his anti-communism and fascist sympathies, many think its the only solution for the communist problem in the north."
chi.3.a:0 "The general invites you to lake Tai."
chi.4.d:0 "After the bombing made in Naking by infiltrated members of our army succeded, Chiang was assassinated, provoking the rise of Wang Jingwei, former leader of the left Kuomintang and close friend of Sun Yat Sen. Now he has reached our government with a proposal to end this madness of a civil war and work together for a better future in China. Some leaders of the party like Mao Zedong have already shown their disavowal for this proposition, while others like Zhang Lan have agreed with Wang Ming in order to stop this unending civil war."
chi.4.a:0 "For a better future!"
chi.4.b:0 "We won't negotiate with counter-revolutionaries."

chi.5.a:0 "For a better future!"
chi.6.d:0 "[PRC.GetLeader] has refused to our proposal, stating that it's only a trap to purge the communists just like Chiang did in 1927. Reports form Xian state that the communist guerrillas have began attacking our garrisons, and Dai Li has arrived Wuhan with a report stating that a great scism is now happening in Yan'an, as well as a mass army defection in support of our cause."
chi.6.a:0 "It's now or never!"
chi.7.d:0 "Today the Chinese government has offered us protection and the status of autonomous region if we join their administration.

chi.9.a:0 "Let's go."
chi.10.d:0 "We just recieved a message from Nanjing promising us a great future and a fair amount of autonomy if we join them. While it seems like a good offer and would impede an invasion that we may not be able to repel, there is still a possibility that they backdown."

chi.11.d:0 "The government of Yunnan asked us to transfer the control of the region of Sichuan to them. It seems like we would not get any benefit from this, we would loose manpower, resources and factories, but what if we let the Yunnanese have Sichuan in exchange of increase our influence over their economy and army? They would get Sichuan but we wouldn't loose total control over it."
chi.11.a:0 "Send the counter offer."

chi.15.a:0 "All to defeat Nanjing."

chi.19.d:0 "Today the government of Xibei San Ma asked us a favor: Not to interviene in their current conflict with Tibet. The British government dragged us in their last war against Tibet in 1932, which fortunately ended with the Ma Clique backing down. However, now they have resumed their conflicts with the Tibetans, but unlike in the Qinghai-Tibet war, now the fascist nations of Germany and Italy are menacing Europe with another world war, and if there is war in Europe, there is war in India. We shall not create unnecessary fronts."
chi.19.a:0 "Let them have their beloved dessert."
chi.20.d:0 "Today the Ma government has demanded our subjugation, saying that the only way of stopping the Tibetan insurrections is by having total control over our population.

chi.22.a:0 "We will have no mercy."
chi.23.d:0 "Today the government of Sinkiang approached us asking for help against their invaders in the war. Helping them might seem easy, but at the moment our army is not well supplied and our population would not stand another stalemate like in our intervention in the region in 1934. Should we answer to their call?"
chi.23.a:0 "Let's do this quickly."
chi.23.b:0 "Maybe we could just send them some guns?"
chi.24.d:0 "Following the liberation of Alma-ata, we run into a gulag full of people of many ethnicies. They were dirty, seemed exhausted and some of them even appeared to be malnourished. Among them, was an Asian man with a long, shabby beard who spoke to our soldiers from the other side of the fences. He said that he was a general of the Ma army and fought in the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang, and asked us to speak to one of our generals or officicers, however, he could just be a madman or be lying in order to be liberated from his prision. What should we do?"
chi.24.a:0 "Let's make a meeting with him."
chi.24.b:0 "He must be crazy. He will be liberated along with the rest when we reach Moscow."
chi.25.d:0 "After one of our generals met with the man, we discovered something incredible: That weak and dirty man was Ma Zhongying, a general from the Ma Clique who disappeared in 1934 in the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang. After confirming his identity, he was taken into a plane by our forces and driven to the capital, were he would be able to recover. The pilot said that Ma Zhongying spent most of the travel cursing the Soviets, Stalin and communism, as well as saying how much he wanted to go to the front again to seek for his vengeance."

How should we respond?"

However, today generals of the Guangxi Clique decided to call Zhao Hengti back, action that was seen as treason by Li Zongren and his most loyal general, Bai Chongxi. The two caudillos would then send their troops to arrest Zhao and the generals who supported him, starting again a civil war in southern China."
chi.34.a:0 "We shall never surrender!"
chi.35.d:0 "Today we recieved a message from the Federated Provinces of China, proposing us a deal in which we would join their administration in exchange of becoming an autonomous region after they defeat the government of Nanjing. The promised autonomy seems like a good prize, even more if we think about the plans of reunification of Nanjing and Yan'an. How should we respond?"
chi.35.a:0 "Seems like a fair deal."
chi.35.b:0 "Thanks, but no."
chi.36.d:0 "The Federated Provinces of China have offered us to enter their union, promising the status of autonomous region. In their message they also stated that they were doing their best efforts to reunite the nation peacefully, but that they would be forced to reunite it by force if we refused. What should we do?"
chi.36.a:0 "We'll trust them."
chi.36.b:0 "If they want our capital they will have to take it."

chi.37.b:0 "Zhao Hengti, the federalist general!"
chi.38.d:0 "Today the Chinese government approached us with a deal: Creating an autonomous region controlled by China in our treaty port, region which will grant military access to our army and navy. This might be a benefit if we think about the fact that China would be able to help us protect the ports from our enemies, but in the other hand it might just be a trick... How should we respond?"
chi.38.a:0 "Seems like a fair proposition."
chi.38.b:0 "They will not dare to take it."
chi.39.d:0 "After the defeat in the Federalist-Guangxi war, Li Zongren, old warlord of the clique, and Bai Chongxi, his most loyal general, crossed our border along with 12000 exhausted and under-equipped soldiers.

chi.39.a:0 "A free general is a free general."
chi.40.d:0 "Today Ryukichi Tanaka, a Japanese chief of staff and friend of Yan Xishan, met with him in order to convince him to join Japan in an anti-communist alliance. Yan asked to all the Japanese troops to leave Shanxi and a great amount of money in exchange of an alliance, which will be only against the communist governments of China. Now the only thing to do is to wait."
chi.40.a:0 "Maybe we will get something good out of this."
chi.41.d:0 "Ryukichi Tanaka, one of our chief of staff fighting in the Chinese front with Shanxi, came to us with a delegate from Yan Xishan, telling us that after a meeting with the general, he was willing to enact an alliance with us, in exchange of an amount of money and the retreat of our forces from his territory. While it may seem like we would get no benefit from this, not having to care about defending Mengkukuo from the Chinese might free some of our forces, and let us prepare more naval invasions. However, it seems like the general is not very convinced about our intentions, so he might change his mind about joining us, but for the good of his people, it's likely that he would not attack us again in case of enacting a truce with us. How should we respond?."
chi.41.a:0 "It is worth the money."
chi.41.b:0 "A truce would benefit us both."
chi.41.c:0 "We won't negotiate with inferiors."
chi.42.d:0 "To our suprise, the government of Japan accepted our proposal to join their faction, and assured that they would pay the demanded amount of money at the moment we joined them. However, Yan Xishan doesn't seem too convinced, and thinks it is all a trap of the Japanese to take military control of the zone, how should we respond?"
chi.42.a:0 "Better dishonor than death."
chi.42.b:0 "A truce will be enough."
chi.43.d:0 "Today the government of Shanxi asked us for a general to command their forces in order to improve the quality of their army. Some people among our government proposed to send Sadao Araki, the leader of the Kodoha faction, to help them, while others proposed Yoshijiro Umezu, a member of the Toseiha faction. However, we could also just refuse to send any."
chi.43.a:0 "Sadao Araki might help them."
chi.43.b:0 "Yoshijiro Umezu will do a great job."
chi.43.c:0 "Do they think we are a general shop or something?"
chi.44.d:0 "Due to the ever increasing conflicts between the CPC and Shanxi, today a guerrilla force was sent to Taiyuan with the objective of assassinating Yan Xishan and taking control over the region. Fortunately they did not succed in killing him, but they provoked a full scale uprising all over Shanxi, commanded by Zhou Enlai, which after Yan Xishan escaped to Beijing, took power over the clique. After noticing their defeat was evident, the remaining generals scaped to Beijing as well, where they probably would join the Nanjing forces as soon as possible."
chi.44.a:0 "The revolution has succeded!"
chi.45.d:0 "Due to the ever increasing conflicts between the CPC and Shanxi, today a guerrilla force was sent to Taiyuan with the objective of assassinating Yan Xishan and taking control over the region.

chi.45.a:0 "We will rescue your homes from the claws of the communists, whatever it takes."
chi.46.d:0 "Just like the first coup organized by the Russian Guihua in 1933 against Jin Shuren, the Guihua cavalry corps have taken control over the country to end the tyranny of Sheng Shicai. After succeding at invading the capital and killing the few chinese guards protecting the palace, they captured Sheng Shicai and excecuted him in the streets of Urumqi. Finally, they appointed Ma Shaowu, a renowed general member of the Kuomintang, as the new leader of the nation."
chi.46.a:0 "Will this provoke a second Russian intervention in Xinjiang?"
chi.47.d:0 "Today the government of Sinkiang has arrested our advisors, following their new anti-communist stance. Invading them might seem easy, but at the moment our army is not well supplied and our population would not stand another stalemate like in our intervention in the region in 1934. How should we respond?"
chi.47.a:0 "Let's do this quickly."
chi.47.b:0 "Just issue a diplomatic protest."
chi.48.d:0 "Today Ma Shaowu approached our government with an interesting proposal: Uniting our administrations as well as our armed forces. While it may seem that there are no downsides to this action, maybe it would be better for us to have them as our vassal, instead of a brother..."
chi.48.a:0 "We'll be stronger together."
chi.48.b:0 "We have other plans for Xinjiang..."
chi.49.d:0 "Today the Ma clique approached our government with an interesting proposal: Uniting our administrations as well as our armed forces. While it may provide us protection against Moscow, it would mean to sacrifice our independence."
chi.49.a:0 "We'll be stronger together."
chi.49.b:0 "We appreciate our liberty."
chi.50.d:0 "Early this week, prince Mehmed Abdülkerim Efendi of the Ottoman house arrived Sinkiang to take power of the nation, after being appointed as the new leader by the Guihua corps. Some people among the government began proposing the idea of uniting our nations, so we become stronger and are able to better defend ourselves from the Russians, strategy that obiously would cost part of our autonomy. This decision remains in the king's hands, should we join the new Ottoman Empire?"
chi.50.a:0 "Let's hope it doesn't collapses again."
chi.50.b:0 "What a stupid idea."
chi.51.d:0 "The government of Afganistan congratulated us for the coronation of Mehmed Abdülkerim Efendi, and to celebrate, they proposed a union between our two nations. People was astonished by this proposition, but the sultan along with the Guihua corps decided that it would benefit us both to enact this union."
chi.51.a:0 "The Ottoman Empire grows stronger!"
chi.52.d:0 "Today the government of Sinkiang, now known as the Ottoman Empire, has excecuted our advisors, following their new anti-communist stance. Our people is strongly demanding our government to punish the Ottomans, and not doing so would surely anger them. Nonetheless, the decision remains in our great leader's hands."
chi.52.a:0 "They will regret ever existing!"
chi.52.b:0 "What would we gain from invading a couple of mountains in a desert?."
chi.53.d:0 "Today a delegation from the Russian government of Sinkiang arrived our country with a message they wanted us to keep in secret. White guerrillas are currently preparing a coup in Eastern Russia, taking control of all the states between Kamchatka and Krasnoyarsk. They invite us to join them in their war against Moscow when the revolt ignites, however they have told us that the revolution is still in preparation, but they will notify us 120 days before the coup begins."
chi.53.a:0 "We will take their offer into consideration."
chi.54.d:0 "The Second Russian Civil War began after exiled White Russians and Japanese attaches ignited a revolt in Eastern Russia. Due to our country being currently almost encircled by the White forces, our government has broken our alliances with Moscow to preserve our independence and impede the loss of Mongolian lives in a battle that does not benefit us. However, some people have seen this as an opportunity to occupy Tannu Tuva, while others think that it would just anger the Soviets, provoking them to invade our country." 
chi.54.a:0 "Nobody will notice it's gone."
chi.54.b:0 "Let's not take a side in this conflict."
chi.55.d:0 "Today we recieved the message from the White Russian government in Sinkiang, reminding us that they will begin the revolt in exactly 120 days, and that they'd appreciate our support in their operation. Helping them may end up benefiting us, making the newly stablished Russian government more willing to collaborate us in the future, as well as providing us a reliant oil supply, however, nothing assures our win in this war, and most probably the Russian government of Sinkiang will not give us any territories besides Sakhalin, unless of course, we find a way to demand them to do so..."
chi.55.a:0 "Moscow won't be as lucky as in 1922!"
chi.55.b:0 "It's not worth the losses."
chi.56.d:0 "The Japanese government has accepted to support us in our struggle against the government of Moscow. We won't fall this time!"
chi.56.a:0 "Petrograd shall be ours again!"
chi.57.d:0 "The Japanese government has ignored our message inviting them to support us in our struggle against the government of Moscow. However, this won't stop us from reclaiming our homeland."
chi.57.a:0 "We will have to do this alone."
chi.58.d:0 "Now that the war with the government of Moscow has ended, it is time to demand to Russia our deserved compensation for our support in the Second Russian Civil War, but the question is, what should we ask to the Russians?"
chi.58.a:0 "We deserve to hold Eastern Russia!"
chi.58.b:0 "War reparations will be enough."
chi.59.d:0 "Today we recieved a message from Japan demanding us to transfer them control over the states of the Far East in exchange for the support they provided us in the Second Russian Civil War. We are most probably not strong enough to defeat their army, airforce and navy, and we are not in a position to fight another war in Siberia, but abandoning the people who fought for us in the civil war would surely anger our population, and reduce their support to our government."
chi.59.a:0 "We have no option..."
chi.59.b:0 "Maybe they would accept another alternative."
chi.59.c:0 "We will defend our people until the end!"
chi.60.d:0 "Today we recieved a message from Japan demanding us to pay them war reparations in exchange for the support they provided us in the Second Russian Civil War. Currently our economy is not at its best state, but they are threatening us with a declaration of war if we refuse, and we are most probably not strong enough to defeat their army, airforce and navy, and we are not in a position to fight another war in Siberia."
chi.60.a:0 "Well, could be worse..."
chi.60.b:0 "Are they joking?"
chi.61.d:0 "The Russian government answered our ultimatum with an interesting proposal: The creation of a buffer state in the Far East. This newly created country would be de iure an autonomous region of Russia, but would mostly function as a totally independent state. We and the Russians will have military access to it and will also guarantee its independence in case of an attack of a foreign country, or from one of us..."
chi.61.a:0 "Fair enough."
chi.61.b:0 "This is an insult to our nation! Banzai!"
chi.62.d:0 "Now that the government of Moscow is not a menace anymore, it is time to restore the tsardom in Russia, but after the assassination of Nicholas the II's family in the Russian Civil War, many Romanov began claiming the throne.

chi.66.a:0 "Long live the Tsar!"
chi.67.d:0 "Today the Russian government has approached us proposing us joining their sphere of influence in exchange of a great amount of economic investiments. Our country's economy is not currently great, and if we refuse we could easily anger them, but is it worth sacrifying our hardly earned independence?"
chi.67.a:0 "We have no option, don't we?"
chi.67.b:0 "Our freedom is more important."

The uprising ended up being suppressed by the military with help of the Liga Patriótica Argentina, but the end of anarcho-syndicalism in the Patagonia came in 1930 after dictator Uriburu banned the communist and anarchist press.

At first his mother and her family were hesitant about making their child king of China and mistrusted Zhang, but after days trying to convince them of joining the new Fengtian government, they folded.\n\nNow the leader of the Yiguandao only has to get rid of the family, but killing them all but the child would be too obvious, people would begin asking questions and those questions would one day reach Rongji's ears.

Why would some normal criminal go and kill all the family of the king just to steal some gold? It will be never known. \n\nAlthough this is a tragedy, the Chinese people must not worry, king Zhu Rongji lives! He fortunately was with regent Zhang Tianran in a temple while the carnage happened.

He was told that he was being arrested due to an unending amount of crime accusations on him. \n\nThe leader of the Yiguandao freezed for a moment, to then command his guards, who seemed totally overwhelmed, to shot at the coup stagers, but they hesitated. While he looked at the shocked faces of his guards, he heard the sound of a pistol being shot, to then feel an enormous pain in his abdomen. \n\nZhang fell down and began quivering as he felt how life was escaping from his body. "Shoot them!" he babbled, but he heard no response from his guards. "I'll now meet you, eternal mother" he finally said with his last breath. The madness had finally come to an end."

Now a red dawn shines in Germany, and only time will tell if they will liberate the workers of their chains, or end up turning Germany into a dictatorship of the party, just like Stalin did to the Soviet Union."

Time passed and opposition to Vargas was either arrested or exiled, the 1934 constitution was rewritten to give all power over the nation to the president, and in a 30-minute-long radio speech, Getúlio Vargas declared the corporativist Estado Novo, inspired on its Portuguese counterpart and the Fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini. \n\nThe coup was regarded with hostility by the USA, the British and South America, which fear that this new semi-Fascist regime might turn into another warmonger Nazi Germany."

However, this wouldn't last long, as yesterday president Vargas was shot by an unidentified person in the streets of Rio de Janeiro. Getúlio Vargas passed away later that day. \nAccording to those who witnessed his death, one of the last things he said before departing this life was "I can't die, not now. There's a lot to be done yet". \n\nMay he now rest in peace, unlike his country that is now being led by Filinto Müller, chief of the secret police known for his brutality and support towards Nazi Germany."

In it  was signed the peace deal between the Brazilian and Toninha (or Porpoise, as they are known in English) people, officially ending the Toninha War of 1918, as well as authorizing the recruitment of Toninha sailors in their struggle against the invaders of the nation. \n\nThe decision was received with enthusiasm between both parts, and now it seems that former enemies will now fight together against the threats that now menace the independence of their homeland."
